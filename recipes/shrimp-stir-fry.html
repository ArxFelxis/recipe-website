        comes together in less than 30 minutes for a quick and easy dinner! Serve over rice or with noodles, and enjoy.</h2>
    <p>Shrimp stir fry is a quick, vibrant dish where tender shrimp are tossed with crisp vegetables in a hot pan. 
        The high heat sears the shrimp just enough to stay juicy while locking in flavor. A savory sauce, often soy, based with garlic, 
        ginger, or chili—coats everything, tying the seafood sweetness to the crunch of the vegetables. It is a fast, 
        colorful meal that balances protein, texture, and bold flavor in each bite.</p>
