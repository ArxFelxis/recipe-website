    <h2>Try these apple cider stuffed Hawaiian rolls that are reminiscent of apple donuts.</h2>
    <p>Apple cider Hawaiian roll donuts are pillowy-soft rolls transformed into golden, sugared treats with a spiced autumn twist. 
        The dough is light and slightly sweet, enriched by the tropical flavor of Hawaiian rolls. 
        After frying, they are dusted in cinnamon sugar and sometimes glazed with tangy apple cider reduction for brightness. 
        The result is a cozy mashup of orchard warmth and island sweetness in every bite.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 12-count package Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
            <li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger 
                opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.  </li>
            <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.</li>
            <li>Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
